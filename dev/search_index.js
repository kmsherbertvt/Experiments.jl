I think it's good practice to always try boiling a problem down     to scalar inputs and outputs when you can,     but it won't always work. Personally, I see this framework as useful for late-stage research:     I have already figured out what the trends are,     I know what I want to plot,     and I can use this package to help me generate a lot of data.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Modules = [Experiments]","category":"page"},{"location":"#Experiments.Experiments","page":"Home","title":"Experiments.Experiments","text":"A unique collection of variables and instructions to generate useful data.\n\nImplementation\n\nDefining a new experiment requires implementing five structs and four methods.\n\nThe structs to be implemented are:\n\nControl contains all control variables, and serves as primary dispatch object\nSetup contains all complex objects calculable from just control variables\nIndependent contains all independent variables (ie. stuff you plan to plot against)\nResult contains all complex objects calculated from independent variables\nDependent contains all dependent variables (ie. stuff you plan to plot)\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nOne of the main functions of Control, Independent, and Dependent     is to be written to a csv file. Thus, all attributes in these structs must be directly serializable     without tabs or newlines.\n\nThe methods to be implemented are:\n\ninitialize(::Control)::Setup\nmapindex(::Control, ::Integer)::Independent\nThis maps an integer index to a specific selection of independent variables,       facilitating en masse data collection.\nruntrial(::Control, ::Setup, ::Independent)::Result\nsynthesize(::Control, ::Setup, ::Independent, ::Result)::Dependent\n\nBy implementing these methods, several additional methods are automatically available.
