""" A unique collection of variables and instructions to generate useful data.

# Implementation
Defining a new experiment requires implementing five structs and four methods.

The structs to be implemented are:
- `Control` contains all control variables, and serves as primary dispatch object
- `Setup` contains all complex objects calculable from just control variables
- `Independent` contains all independent variables (ie. stuff you plan to plot against)
- `Result` contains all complex objects calculated from independent variables
- `Dependent` contains all dependent variables (ie. stuff you plan to plot)

## IMPORTANT:
One of the main functions of `Control`, `Independent`, and `Dependent`
    is to be written to a csv file.
Thus, all attributes in these structs must be directly serializable
    without tabs or newlines.

The methods to be implemented are:
- `initialize(::Control)::Setup`
- `mapindex(::Control, ::Integer)::Independent`

    This maps an integer index to a specific selection of independent variables,
        facilitating en masse data collection.

- `runtrial(::Control, ::Setup, ::Independent)::Result`
- `synthesize(::Control, ::Setup, ::Independent, ::Result)::Dependent`

By implementing these methods, several additional methods are automatically available.
The most important of these is `collectdata`, so find its documentation too!
